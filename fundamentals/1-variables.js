// VARIABLES ARE CONTAINER THAT IS USED TO STORE DATA - JS USES 3 TYPES OF VARIABLES var, let ,const BUT VAR IS NOT NECESSARILY USED IN MODERN JS TODAY

// VAR - IT IS THE FIRST AND ONLY VARIABLE THAT IS USED IN OLD SYNTAX

var name = 'Mel';
name = 'John';
// console.log(name);

// CONST - IT IS A VARIABLE THAT CANNOT REASIGN AND CANNOT ASSIGN WITHOUT A VALUE OR PROPERTY
const laptop = 'ASUS-X5001';
console.log(laptop);

// LET - IT IS LIKE A VAR WE CAN ASSIGN AND REASIGN THIS VARIABLE
let monitorBrand = 'ASUS';
monitorBrand = 'lg'
console.log(monitorBrand);

// BONUS NOTE - THERE ARE 3 DIFF TYPES OF MULTI WORD TO DECLARE VARIABLES IN JS AND SOME OF THEM ARE USED SPECIFICALY IN SOME CASES
let firstName = 'John Doe'; // CAMEL CASE - THE FIRST LETTER ON FIRST WORD IS SMALL AND THE SECOND WORD IS CAPITAL --- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
let first_name = 'Jane Doe'; // UNDERSCORE METHOD - WHERE IN THE WORDS ARE SEPARATED IN _ THIS CASE IS USED IN COMPLEX VARIABLES AND TARGETING HIGHLY SECURED DATA
let FirstName = 'John Smith'; // PASCAL CASE - THIS IS MOSTLY USED IN JAVA PHP 

// BONUS NOTE - VARIABLES CANNOT START IN NUMBERS BUT CAN START WITH LETTERS OR $ OR _
