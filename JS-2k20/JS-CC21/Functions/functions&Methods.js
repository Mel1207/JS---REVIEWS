const firstName = 'Mel';

// Functions
const greet = () => 'Hi there!'
let result = greet ();

console.log(result)


// Methods
let resultTwo = firstName.toUpperCase();
console.log(resultTwo);

// Note: Functions and methods are similar but different on where we invoke them, methods are just a functions but can only be invoked by (.) dot notation, this methods are already inside the browser. but we can create our own method too.
